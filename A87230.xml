            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

late Book, call'd <hi>Weakneſs above Wickedneſs;</hi> wherein thou wilt
finde, that they have made Lyes their refuge, though they call themſelves,
<hi>The Seed of God,</hi> and <hi>The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Juſt:</hi> for, did
ever the Seed of God, or the Generation of the Juſt, ſay, That a man hath
not done that which he did do, or that a man hath done that which he never did?
Nay, it is rare to finde any of the Seed of the Devil grown up to that degree
of Impudence, as to charge a man with publiſhing that which he never
publiſhed, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing that which is publiſhed to the world in
print, as theſe men have done by me: But ſurely they think that no man will
take pains to compare book to book, but will believe all that they ſay; but
ſure the wiſe have learned otherwiſe, though the ſimple believe every
thing. I ſhall therefore deſire thee to compare their Anſwer to my Book,
with the Book, and both with this Reply, and ſee if ever any men have lyed
with that ſtock of Impudence, as theſe men have done. Indeed I am no
Prophet, nor the Son of a Prophet; but ſure I am, that theſe men are
filling up the meaſure of their Iniquity, and <pb facs="tcp:118668:3"/>that very greedily,
as though their hearts were hardened from fear, and as though they had made a
league with Death, and with Hell were at an agreement; otherwiſe the fear of
either would have taught them to have laid aſide their wickedneſs, which
they ſtill inlarge the borders of, till ſuch time wrath comes upon them to
the uttermoſt, and the Lord ſay of them, That they ſhall be called the
border of wickedneſs, and the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt whom he hath indignation for

repent (if there be any place for repentance for them) before the Lord give
them over to the plagues of their own hearts, as I fear he hath done many of
them already.</p>

<hi>having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot iron,</hi> to be none of the

which I ſhall make appear (God aſſiſting me) by what <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118668:4"/>follows, in anſwer to their Book, call'd <hi>Weakneſs above
Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the more orderly proceeding herein, I ſhall firſt
ſpeak to the Title-page of it, where they are pleaſed to call their book,
<hi>THE QUAKERS DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCE,</hi> &amp;c. Here I do obſerve one thing, That my
book hath made theſe men own themſelves Quakers; for they were aſhamed of
their Names before, and uſually call'd themſelves, <hi>Such as were
NICK-NAMED Quakers;</hi> yet now they call their book, <hi>The QUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERS
Defence.</hi> So that here they did tell a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lye,<note place="margin">His firſt LYE.</note> in ſaying, <hi>The WORLD did Nick-name
them Quakers,</hi> when they give that Name to themſelves.</p>
            <p>I now come to the book it ſelf, where he begins, and ſayes,
<hi>pag.</hi> 1. That <hi>the Apoſtle well knew what he ſaid, when he
deſired the Saints prayers, That he might be delivered from men without
faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Truly, the Devil ſpeaks truth ſometimes, and ſo do you, in
ſaying, <hi>The Apoſtle well knew what he ſaid;</hi> but ſurely, you
are no Apoſtles, that ſpeak things you know not, and are vainly puft up
with a fleſhly minde, as appears by what I have ſaid in my laſt, and
ſhall yet further make manifelt in due place.</p>
            <p>Thou telleſt me,<note place="margin">His <hi>2.</hi> LYE.</note>
That <hi>I deny the Faith of God, which is the gift of God in his Saints,</hi>
&amp;c. This I never did, either by word or writing: And though he ought to
have proved, that I denied the Faith, being he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it upon me, yet he
brings no proof at all, but his bare aſſertion. I ſhall therefore give
the Reader ſome ſayings of mine, and leave him to judge, whether they look
like the words of a man that did deny the Faith of God, and ſet up a Faith of
his own, as he falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth me. As firſt, in my Epiſtle to the
Churches, I <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118668:4"/>call upon them, to <hi>take heed that they were
not ſpoiled of their joy and confidence they had in CHRIST JESUS;</hi> and,
<hi>that they would let none of the words of OUR LORD JESUS ſlip out of their
minde;</hi> and, <hi>that they would have high and honourable thoughts of the
SCRIPTURES;</hi> and, <hi>that they would prize the Ordinances of GOD;</hi> and
<hi>pag.</hi> 16. of my book, I do exhort, <hi>that men would take heed of
turning the Truth of GOD into a Lye:</hi> Nay, doth not he tell me, That <hi>I
did confeſs, that Chriſt lighteth every man that comes into the world,</hi>
in his anſwer, pag. 5? And do not I all along through my book, profeſs
Chriſt to be the <hi>SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD,</hi> and <hi>JUDGE</hi> of the
World? and is not this the Faith of God? and yet this man ſayes, <hi>I deny
the Faith of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond page he inſiſts upon ſome things, which (he
ſaith) I ſpake at <hi>Gerrard Roberts</hi> houſe, which I ſhall take
notice of hereafter; becauſe he is ſo full of Tautalogies, and ſpeaks
very often in his book, of ſomething relating thereto, and therefore it will
be loſt labour to ſpeak to any thing, till I come to ſpeak to the whole.
The reſt of the ſecond page hath little beſides, but a pack of ſwelling
words of vanity; as <hi>Vain Philoſophy, Deceitful Craft, Unreaſonable
blaſphemous Doctrines, Curſed Art,</hi> charging me with <hi>ſetting up
the ſpirit of the Devil;</hi> and, <hi>that I had muſtered up a heap of
Lyes, and a heap of Subtilty,</hi> &amp;c. Let me tell thee, <hi>James,</hi>
theſe words had done well, when thou hadſt proved me ſo; and then they
would better have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Concluſion, then the Preface of thy book.</p>
            <p>Thou goeſt on, and ſayeſt, in the latter end of p. 2. that
<hi>thou wilt not trouble thy ſelf to anſwer every particular of my vain
ſtories,</hi> &amp;c. Truly, I do believe, that thou wouldſt be as much
troubled to anſwer to them, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118668:5"/>and prove them ſo, as ever
thou waſt in thy life; and therefore it was cunningly thought on by thee, to
eaſe thy ſelf of the trouble, and call them Lyes, vain ſtories, and
ſlanders: Here thou haſt done like thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thou goeſt on, and quarrelſt with my Epiſtle to the
Churches, and ſayeſt, <hi>If my brethren, with me, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Faith
of Chriſt, and ſet up a Faith of their own, it is like my work will be
welcome.</hi> To this I have anſwered already in my Reply to thy firſt
Page: and becauſe I will not call this another Lye, I ſhall onely ſay it
is the former Lye reiterated the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>Thou leapeſt over my Epiſtle to the Reader, and ſayeſt
nothing to it, though therein thou waſt more concerned, then in the Epiſtle
to the Churches: and from thence comeſt to ſpeak a little, to little
purpoſe, in pag. 3. of thy book, and that is, That <hi>you ſhall not
contend whether the world call you that which is true, or that which is
falſe, when they call you Quakers.</hi> If ſo, then why haſt thou
troubled thy ſelf ſo farre, as to call them <hi>Iſhmaels Brood,</hi> that
call you ſo? Your jugling and lying at this turn, which I charge you with in
the ſecond and third pages of my book, thou ſayeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, but that
<hi>thou wilt not trouble thy ſelf whether the world truly or falſly call
you ſo.</hi> Oh ſhameleſs wretch! doſt thou ſay thou art Nick-named,
when thou art call'd Quaker? And when I have uſed arguments to prove thee a
Lyer, in ſaying, <hi>The world Nick-names thee,</hi> becauſe thou nameſt
thy ſelf ſo; thou ſhakeſt all off with this, that <hi>thou wilt not
contend whether they call'd thee truly or falſly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His
<hi>3.</hi> LYE.</note> But by the way, if they did call thee truly, then thou
art a Lyer, in ſaying they Nick-named thee.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118668:5"/>
            <p>Thou goeſt on, and in page 3. of thy book, thou telleſt me,
that <hi>I lyed, in ſaying you foamed at the mouth in your tremblings,</hi>
&amp;c. But <hi>James,</hi> remember, that it is not thy bare ſaying <hi>I
lye,</hi> that proves it ſo: and thou doeſt pretend (that ſo I may
repent) to inform me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But am I better informed that you did not foam,
becauſe you ſay I lye, in charging you with foaming? Reade, and judge: and
yet this is all you bring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me better. And whereas you ſay. That
<hi>though it was caſt upon you in the</hi> Weſtmerland <hi>Petition, and
you did not anſwer to it; it doth not follow</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that the
Charge was therefore true.</hi> To this I reply, That if you had overlooked
thoſe paſſages in the Charge, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there might be ſomewhat in
what you ſay: But you printed thoſe particular paſſages, how that you
were charged with ſwellings and foamings, and that in young children, and yet
ſay nothing to the untruth of them. And though I have again urged the ſame
things, yet you ſay nothing to your ſwelling and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it be
charged to be in young children.</p>
            <p>And whereas in your Anſwer you deny foamings, yet you do not
deny any other part of my Charge. By this the world may ſee thy wickedneſs,
that thou waveſt the moſt material things, and ſaiſt nothing to
them.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>I lyed,</hi> and <hi>the
Petitioners lyed,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>you foamed:</hi> I demand, why both my
ſelf and the Petitioners have not better ground to ſay thou lyeſt, in
denying it, ſeeing thou haſt waved an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to it, both when your
ſelves did print the Charge, and alſo when I did charge you with it
afreſh in my book? But I do think, that this was one thing that
<hi>James</hi> was not willing to TROUBLE himſelf <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118668:6"/>with
anſwering: for I perceive, and ſo may the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he mindes my book and
his Anſwer, That he could not tell how to deny what I and the Petitioners of
<hi>Weſtmerland</hi> did charge againſt them.</p>
            <p>You now proceed, and in the latter end of page 3. and page 4. you
ſay, that <hi>I can finde nothing of the TRUTH you preach that I dare
accuſe you of.</hi> Well ſaid, <hi>James,</hi> thou wilt ſpeak Truth
ſometimes, though it be againſt thy Father the Devils will: for tou
ſayeſt, That <hi>I can finde nothing of the TRUTH you preach that I dare to
accuſe you of.</hi> Indeed that's true; for I dare not accuſe any for
holding Truth: But then it ſeems, if I have accuſed you of any thing that
you preach, it is of the Lyes you preach. This muſt needs follow; for if (as
thou ſayeſt) I dare not accuſe thee of the Truths you preach, and yet do
accuſe you of many things that you preach, as my book declares at large; then
it follows, that all that I accuſe you with, is of the Lyes you preach; for
you have juſtified me, that I did not dare to accuſe you of the TRUTHS you
preach.</p>
            <p>But in the 3 and 4 pages of thy book, thou ſayeſt, That <hi>I
do accuſe you of ſomewhat that you never preached;</hi> viz. <hi>That you
ſay, Nothing muſt be called Gods Word, but Chriſt: This</hi> (you ſay)
<hi>is none of your Doctrine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>4.</hi>
LYE.</note> But I wonder who hath ever heard you (unleſs it be ſuch as are
deeply drenched in hypocriſie, and have learned your art of Equivocation, but
will ſay the ſame thing that I ſay of you.)</p>
            <p>You ſay alſo, That <hi>I lye, in ſaying you deny the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the Word of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>5.</hi>
LYE.</note> &amp;c. But have not I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from your own writings, pag. 6.
of my book? And do you not reprove in many places of your books 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118668:6"/>the People and Prieſt, for calling the Writings <hi>The
Word.</hi> Oh ſhameleſs man! to call me a Lyer, for ſaying nothing of
them, but what I have under their own hands. And where my arguments againſt
thee are of that force, that thou knoweſt not how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; Thou
telleſt the Reader, That <hi>it is falſe in my ſenſe, to ſay thou
denieſt the Scriptures to be the Word of God. James,</hi> do not juggle; for
I did not ſay you denied the Scriptures to be the Word of God in my
ſenſe, but in your own words, that may be found in the books I have cited,
and which are owned by you.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: <hi>James</hi> jumps through the 7 and 8 pages of
my book, where I make it appear, That they give thoſe Titles to their own
Pamphlets, that they will not give to the Scriptures; and thereupon do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a queſtion: To all which <hi>James</hi> anſwers not a word. Reader,
remember what <hi>James</hi> ſaid at firſt, namely, That he would not
trouble himſelf to anſwer all; and by this he frees himſelf very
cunningly from anſwering to the moſt material things I urge againſt
him.</p>
            <p>He comes now to ſpeak to the third Error I charge them with, and
that is, That <hi>they preach they are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſent, and cannot prove
it.</hi> To this he makes his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by ſaying, <hi>If he had come in his
own name, I would have received him.</hi> But how doth this appear true?<note place="margin">His <hi>6.</hi> LYE.</note> for what though I will not believe a
man that comes in Gods name, when God never ſent him; doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow, that I muſt needs believe one that comes in his own name?</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith in this fourth page of his book, That
<hi>it is plainly ſeen of what ſpirit I am of, becauſe <pb n="8" facs="tcp:118668:7"/>I ſet it down as an Error, that he preacheth,</hi> viz. <hi>That they
are ſent immediately of God:</hi> Now here he playes the Serpents part, for
he leaves out that which is moſt material: for I never ſaid it was an Error
for men to ſay they were ſent of God, if they could prove it; but, that it
was Error and Preſumption for one to ſay it that could not prove it: which
words, <hi>AND COULD NOT PROVE IT,</hi> though that be the ſcope of the
Charge, as any one may ſee, that reades the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences contained in the 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 pages of my book: For I never denied, but a man
that could prove his ſending, might ſay God ſent him; but the thing I
denied, was, That it was Error and Preſumption to ſay it, when it could not
be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as I have largely declared in the laſt fore-cited pages, which
<hi>James</hi> leaps over, and ſaith nothing to, though therein the two
chiefeſt of our Conferences are publiſhed, with the Arguments and
Anſwers, to which he ſaith nothing.</p>
            <p>He now comes to tell us, That <hi>the Apoſtles ſaid they were
ſent of God, who did not work Miracles in the ſight of all they preached
to,</hi> page. 4. See this mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: I challenge him to tell us he did a
Miracle at any time for to prove his Miniſtery, and he anſwers, That
<hi>the Apoſtles did not work Miracles before ALL they preached to.</hi> But
<hi>James,</hi> canſt thou prove thou haſt wrought a Miracle before ANY
thou haſt preached to? Now I ſee thou art put to thy ſhifts: for thou
didſt ſay in thy Letter to me, and alſo in thy Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at
<hi>Beech-lane,</hi> That <hi>there were many ſent immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, that
did no Miracle.</hi> And now my book hath put thee upon ſaying, that <hi>they
that were ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of God, did not do Miracles at all times, before
all <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118668:7"/>they preached to.</hi> But how doth this juſtifie thee,
who canſt not ſay thou haſt done a Miracle at any time?</p>
            <p>Thou goeſt on ſtill in page 4. and ſayeſt, That <hi>I call
that an Error, which all the Miniſters of Chriſt did own,</hi> p. 4. and
thou alſo ſayſt, That <hi>that which I call Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, thou owneſt:</hi>
and yet but a little before, thou ſayeſt, That <hi>I can finde nothing of
the Truth you preach, that I dare accuſe you of,</hi> page 3. Now if I dare
not (as you ſay) accuſe you of any Truth you preach; then it muſt needs
follow, that thou art an Heretick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in thy ſelf, and that thoſe
are Errors that I charge upon thee; for I dare not (thou ſayeſt) accuſe
any of the Truth you preach.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſay, page 4. That <hi>you make proof of your
Miniſtery as the Apoſtles did, in partience, in affliction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His
<hi>7.</hi> LYE.</note>
               <hi>and neceſsities,</hi> &amp;c. For ſhame,
<hi>James,</hi> hold thy tongue at this turn, and let ſome-body elſe
ſpeak: for, where is thy patience, who fil'ſt thy mouth with great
ſwelling words of vanity againſt all that oppoſe thee? when the Saints
did not give railing for railing, but (like Chriſt) they when they were
reviled, reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But I am ſure, for railing, thou exceedeſt any
of the Society of <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and art fitter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with
Oyſter-women, then about the things of God: For Fool, and Sor, and Devil, and
Traſh, are thy frequent language to any that oppoſe thee. And though you
ſay, <hi>You are perſecuted;</hi> I do challenge thee to ſhew me any that
have opened their mouths againſt you in print, that have given you worſe
language then you have given them; and yet you brag of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: for it
is no better then bragging, when your perſecutors (as you call them) have
better words in their mouthes then your ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118668:8"/>
            <p>But further, you tell us, That <hi>you make proof of your
Miniſtery by afflitions and neceſsities,</hi> &amp;c. I pray what
affliction have you ſuffered, but others, whom you cry down, have ſhared
in, as deep, if not more deep then your ſelves? But as for your
neceſſities, ſurely thou lyeſt at this turn; for thou didſt never go
ſo well when thou followedſt the Plough (in point of Apparel) as thou
doeſt ſince: and it is believed (and that upon good ground) that thy
neceſſities were more before thou waſt a <hi>Quaker,</hi> then they have
been ſince.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſpend the moſt part of the fifth page, to
recite ſome things that thou ſayeſt I left out at a Meeting at
<hi>Gerrard Roberts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>8.</hi> LYE.</note> and
this thou call'ſt, <hi>A diminiſhing Truth to cover Lyes.</hi> If this be
true that thou ſayeſt, then thou art fearfully guilty of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Truth to cover thy Lyes with: For pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if I had printed any part
of the Conference at <hi>Gerrard Roberts,</hi> and had left out other part of
it, that had made moſt againſt me; then he might have had a ground of
complaint: but I printed not a word of it. And muſt a man every time he
prints, print eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conference he hath been at, or elſe if he leaves out
one, and makes no mention of it, be counted a man that diminiſheth Truth to
cover Lyes? See the wickedneſs of this man! when himſelf undertakes to
anſwer my book, he leaves out whole pages, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments of great
importance, together with many things that paſſed at our ſeveral
Conferences, that were of moſt weight; but this muſt not be call'd a
diminiſhing of Truth to cover Lyes: but he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf (as I have
told you) by ſaying <hi>he would not trouble himſelf with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118668:8"/>
            <p>Again, the things which himſelf ſaid at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath
left out, and ſpake not a word to the chief thing in controverſie, and upon
which the Meeting was occaſioned, to wit, about Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and yet
this man ſaith, That I leave out Truth to cover Lyes, when he hath left out
the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Conference, and pick'd up ſomewhat that he
thinks makes againſt me, and chargeth me with other things that I never
ſaid, as ſhall appear in due place.</p>
            <p>He goes on in this 5 page of his book, and repeats ſome things
which (he ſaith) I ſaid at that Meeting. About this he ſpends a great
part of this page; and yet for all that (as though he thought he could not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his Lyes faſt enough) he ſpends three pages more to repeat the
ſame things, which he ſaith he ſent in a Letter to me; as any one may
ſee, that ſhall compare the 5 page with the 6 and 7 of his book. And though
in his Letter, he ſaith ſomething about Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; yet that Letter
was not the Conference, but a Letter ſent after the Conference; and that
appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he mentions not one Argument brought by me at that time in
favour to it, but in ſtead thereof char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me with ſomething that I never
ſaid: Whereas if that Letter were the ſum of the Conference, as
poſſibly he may make ſome believe, why then did not he write the
Arguments I brought for the proof of what I then ſaid, and his Anſwers to
them, which the Letter ſpeaks nothing of?</p>
            <p>And as touching the particulars charged in his Letter, and ſo
often repeated by him, as though he wanted matter; I ſhall firſt ſpeak to
the firſt, and that is, That I ſaid <hi>a man might underſtand the
Scriptures <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118668:9"/>without the Spirit of God.</hi> To this I
anſwer, and that as I then told him, That though all the Myſteries of the
Kingdom of God and Chriſt could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without Gods Spirit,
which the Scripture ſaith <hi>ſhall lead into all truth;</hi> yet much of
the Scripture might be underſtood by men that had not the Spirit; as,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> and the
like: and the Scribes and Prieſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.4. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the
Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt ſhould be born in Bethlehem,</hi> as it was
written by the Prophet, though they had not the Spirit: and ſurely they
underſtood that Scripture right; for accordingly he was born in the ſame
place. This I did anſwer at that time, though he hath left it out; and yet
omiſſion of any thing that he ſaith, is counted an evil.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, that I ſaid, <hi>The Faith by which a man is
ſaved, is not the gift of God.</hi> To this I did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then, and ſo I
do now, That it is not ſo the gift of God, as you imagine by your
Enthuſiaſtical dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; as, That men ſhould meet together, and neither
ſay nor do towards the work of Faith, till they are immediately inſpired
with your quaking dotages: in this ſenſe I do ſtill deny Faith to be Gods
gift; yet in the ſenſe that all thoſe Scriptures ſay <hi>Faith is the
gift of God,</hi> I do freely own it, as my book doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, page 37.
wherein I have theſe words, That <hi>men have nothing but what they have
received, eſpecially any light or knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, according
to</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7.</p>
            <p>The next is, that I ſaid, <hi>The obedience of Believers was not
the gift of God.</hi> To this I anſwer, as before, That we being at that time
diſcourſing about the point of Baptiſm, and I then aſſerting, That
God <pb n="13" facs="tcp:118668:9"/>was to be obeyed in that, as well as others of his
Commands: Thou didſt anſwer, That <hi>they muſt wait till obedience was
given them.</hi> To which I did reply, That God did not give obedience to his
people, in the way that thou didſt expect it, as to ſit ſtill and do
nothing, till men were immediately inſpired to it: And in this ſenſe I do
ſtill deny, That obedience is the gift of God; though I do believe (and am
generally known to teach) that to him that hath improved his talent, God will
give more; and that he that doth his will, ſhall know of his Doctrine. And in
this ſenſe I do believe obedience to be the gift of God, according to
thoſe Scriptures by you alledged; and yet I ſay, None of thoſe Scriptures
prove your obedient actions (which you ſo call) to be Gods gift.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſay that I ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaks that
which men underſtand not, is a Fool, and a Barbarian.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>9.</hi> LYE.</note> Theſe were not the words,
<hi>James:</hi> but indeed, when thou hadſt ſpoke a great while to us, and
then at laſt, when I made ſome Reply upon thy words, thou didſt anſwer,
That <hi>thou ſpakeſt in a language that I could not underſtand;</hi> and
ſo thou ſaidſt upon the like occaſion, at our Meeting in
<hi>Beech-lane,</hi> before many witneſſes, as I have ſhewed in page 10.
of my book, call'd <hi>Quakers quaking:</hi> Hereupon I did anſwer,
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, That <hi>he that ſpeaks in an unknown
tongue, is a Barbarian;</hi> and if I ſaid <hi>a Fool,</hi> I think I might
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> prove it: Not but that I did
then, and do ſtill believe, That Chriſt ſpake many things, and ſo did
his Apoſtles, that the world could not underſtand, becauſe of their
hardneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>You charge me further with ſaying, That <hi>none was baptized
with the holy Ghoſt, but they wrought Miracles.</hi> I ſaid not ſo, but
that <hi>none were baptized with the holy Ghoſt <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118668:10"/>but they
COULD work Miracles;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>10.</hi> LYE.</note> and
ſo I do ſay ſtill, till thou canſt prove it: for not one Text by thee
alledged proves the contrary.</p>
            <p>You tell me that I ſaid,<note place="margin">His <hi>11.</hi>
LYE.</note> 
               <hi>All good was not of God.</hi> This is another of thy Lyes, and
I leave it to thee to prove: Though it may be I might ſay, That <hi>All the
good you glory in, is not of God;</hi> and ſo I ſay ſtill: For you are of
the Generation that <hi>call good evil, and evil good;</hi> but otherwiſe, I
believe with all my heart, that God is the Fountain of all good, according to
the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>You go on, and tell me that I ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was not a
Miniſter of Circumciſion:</hi> And ſo I ſay ſtill, till thou canſt
prove it. And though in thy Letter thou char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt this for an Error; yet thou
doſt not bring one Text, to prove he was a Miniſter of Circumciſion. See
thy deceit!</p>
            <p>Again, thou chargeſt me with Error in thy Letter, in ſaying,
<hi>The Law was not given by Chriſt:</hi> and yet doſt not give me one
Text, to prove that it was given by Chriſt: for the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>The Law was given by Moſes; but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. and yet thou haſt the face to call this one of my
blaſphemous Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Thou tell'ſt me in thy Letter,<note place="margin">His
<hi>12.</hi> LYE.</note> that I ſaid, <hi>The wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where</hi> John
<hi>preached, was in</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>James,</hi> this is like thee and

            <p>He further ſaith,<note place="margin">His <hi>13.</hi> LYE.</note>
That <hi>I ſaid the River</hi> Jordan <hi>was in</hi> Jeruſalem. This is
falſe: for I know that Text well in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. that ſaith
<hi>Ieruſalem went OUT to be baptized of John <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118668:10"/>in
Jordan;</hi> therefore I could not think <hi>Jordan</hi> was in
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But however, it is as reaſonable to think that
<hi>Jordan</hi> ſhould be in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it is for you to teach,
That <hi>Jeruſalem is IN YOU.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on, and tell me that I ſaid,<note place="margin">His
<hi>14.</hi> LYE.</note> 
               <hi>I could foretell things to come, without the
Spirit: This</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>is Witchery.</hi> To this I anſwer,
That this is another of thy Lyes, to ſay, that this is Witchery: for the
Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did foretel things to come, and had not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when they
ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.54, 55. <hi>They knew when it
would be heat and rain, before it came to paſs;</hi> and Chriſt bare them
witneſs that this was true: and the Prieſts &amp; Scribes by the Scriptures
did know, that <hi>Chriſt ſhould be born in Bethlehem,</hi> though they had
not the Spirit: Was not this to foretel a thing to come? and yet this is not
Witchcraft, though thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call it ſo. The reſt of your
Letter conſiſts of Baptiſm: For anſwer thereto, I ſhall refer the
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to my book, call'd <hi>Quakers quaking,</hi> pag. 25, 26, and 38.</p>
            <p>Thus much as touching thy Letter, and thy Charge going before it,
which is the ſame with the Letter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome things which thou
chargeſt me for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which were ſpoken at our Conference at the
<hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> near <hi>Alderſgate;</hi> and them thou
ſayeſt are, Firſt,<note place="margin">His <hi>15.</hi> LYE.</note>
               <hi>That (I ſhould ſay) Chriſt lighteth every one that comes into the
world, and yet deny, that this Light was within every one that comes into the
world.</hi> This thou ſayeſt I have omitted, to cover Lyes: But let me tell
thee, <hi>James,</hi> That if this Light ſpoken of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. had
been in thee, thou wouldſt have been aſhamed to tell thy Reader, That <hi>I
did diminiſh this from the Diſcourſe, to <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118668:11"/>make my
ſelf a cover with a Lye,</hi> when theſe very words are once and again
repeated, as page 49. of my book, call'd <hi>Quakers quaking,</hi> and page 51.
in page 49. I have theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>I did not oppoſe the
ſaying of</hi> Joh. 1. (which is) <hi>that Chriſt inlightens every one that
comes into the world,</hi> but your ſaying (which is) <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in
the world hath the Light within him, ſpoken of in that Text.</hi> Again, in
page 51. I have theſe words, <hi>In like manner he</hi> (viz.) <hi>Chriſt
lighteth every one that comes into the world (inaſmuch as he uſeth means
for the bringing the world to the Light) THOUGH ALL HAVE NOT THIS LIGHT WITHIN
THEM. James,</hi> I have put it into Capital Letters, that thou mayeſt
(without a Pair of Spectacles) ſee thy ſelf a Capital Lyer: for thou art
ſo impudent, as to tell me, <hi>If I had been honeſt, I would have
publiſhed the whole Truth;</hi> and this fore-mentioned paſſage, is one
of the ſayings thou lyingly tell'ſt thy Reader that <hi>I did diminiſh,
to make a cover for a Lye,</hi> when I printed it word for word. See his
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my book, page 5.</p>
            <p>The next Lye he tells his Reader, is, That <hi>I omitted to print
another paſſage that I ſpake in the Conference;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>16.</hi> LYE.</note> 
               <hi>which was, That the Heathen had a
Light that convinced them of ſin, but this Light was not within them.
James,</hi> ſurely thou canſt not forbear lying: for do not I ſay, page
52. that <hi>they might have a Light among them, that might not be within
them?</hi> What is this leſs, then what thou ſayeſt I omitted? and is
this falſe Doctrine? may not God uſe means, and ſend his Light among
people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of ſin, that they may reject, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into
their hearts? Was not the great Light, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, among many, who did
not receive him within them by believing? And yet thou art ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118668:11"/>and ſhameleſs, as to call this a deceit, and falſe
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The next thing thou chargeſt me with, is, That <hi>I did omit
the printing of that ſaying, which,</hi> thou ſayeſt,<note place="margin">His <hi>17.</hi> LYE.</note> 
               <hi>I ſpake at the</hi> Bull
<hi>and</hi> Mouth, <hi>viz. That Chriſt pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſins of every one
that comes into the world.</hi> Now <hi>James,</hi> thou haſt fearfully
diminiſhed the Truth, to make thee a cover for thy Lye: for thou leaveſt
out theſe words that I ſaid, namely, That Chriſt was ſaid to be the
Light of the world, or to lighten every one that came into it, as he was ſaid
to take away the ſin of the world, inaſmuch as he did graciouſly afford
meanes for the pardoning the ſins of the world, though every man ſhould not
have his ſins pardoned. This indeed I ſaid, and to this purpoſe I ſpake
in page 51. of my book; which is juſt contrary to what thou chargeſt: for I
ſay, He doth not pardon the ſins of every one; thou ſayeſt that I
ſaid, Chriſt did pardon the ſins of every one.</p>
            <p>He now proceeds in his 10 page, to attempt an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the
fourth Error I charge upon them, and ſaith,<note place="margin">His
<hi>18.</hi> LYE.</note> 
               <hi>I count it an Error that they bear Teſtimony to
the Light of Chriſt, which lighteth every one that comes into the world;</hi>
and, <hi>That I count it an Error in them, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Spiritual
Light of Chriſt is ſufficient to teach in all the wayes of God,</hi>
&amp;c. and, <hi>That their Error is, for ſaying the light of Chriſt is
Spiritual, and within.</hi> To all this I anſwer, 1. That the Reader may
ſee that in thy fore-going Letter thou haſt laid to my charge things that I
never ſaid: for thou that wilt adde to, and diminiſh from my words that are
publiſhed in print, wilt not ſtick to do the like unto words that were
ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more privately: For where do I charge any of <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118668:12"/>the
fore mentioned things upon you for Error? I challenge thee to ſhew it me in
any page of my book; or elſe confeſs thy wickedneſs before God and men:
and that thy ſin may appear at this turn, I ſhall deſire the Reader to
peruſe the fourth Error I charge upon you, in page 18. of my book, where I do
not charge it as Error, That you teſtifie to the Light of Chriſt that is
ſpoken of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. but the words are, that (you ſay) <hi>Every man
hath a Light within him, that will teach him to worſhip God rightly:</hi> And
thereupon it is, that I do ground my twelve <hi>Quaeres,</hi> page 19, 20, 21.
of my book; and not whether it be an Error to teſtifie to the Light of
Chriſt, as thou falſly ſuggeſteſt: for though it be a Truth, as I
often declare in my book, That Chriſt is the Light of the world; yet it is an
Error, and an unwritten Conceit, to ſay, That <hi>EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY MAN hath a Light
within him, that will teach him to worſhip God aright,</hi> without any other
means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed.</p>
            <p>And in what page of my book do I count it an Error in you, for
ſaying, <hi>The Spiritual Light of Chriſt is ſufficient to teach in all
the wayes of God,</hi> as thou falſly ſaith I have?<note place="margin">His
<hi>19.</hi> LYE.</note> Nay, do not I ſay (and doeſt not thou confeſs in
page 10. of thy book, that I ſay) <hi>It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi> &amp;c. And
where canſt thou ſhew me, that I charge it upon you as Error, for ſaying,
<hi>The Light of Chriſt is ſufficient,</hi> as thou falſly haſt
declared?</p>
            <p>Again, where do I charge it upon you as Error, for ſaying,<note place="margin">His <hi>20.</hi> LYE.</note> 
               <hi>The Light of Chriſt is
ſpiritual, and within,</hi> as you ſay I do? Do I ſay any ſuch thing in
my whole book? No, no, <hi>I have not ſo learned Chriſt;</hi> and yet this
you ſay is the Error I charge upon you. For ſhame, <hi>James,</hi> leave
off lying, and ſpeak truth from <pb n="19" facs="tcp:118668:12"/>thy heart; for my charge
is not, That you ſay the Light of Chriſt is Spiritual and within, but that
you ſay it is <hi>WITHIN EVERY MAN that comes into the world;</hi> that's the
Error I charge: and in ſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that which I object, thou
anſwereſt that which I never objected, as my book at large will
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
            <p>You proceed in page 11. to anſwer my <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and
therein thou anſwereſt to that I never asked: For 1. I ask, What need there
is of the Scripture to declare the minde of God, if it may be known without it
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as well: And you ſay I ask,<note place="margin">His <hi>22.</hi>
LYE.</note> 
               <hi>What need there is of the Scriptures to declare the minde of
God;</hi> importing to the Reader, (as all may perceive) both in the
<hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> and <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That I was a man that judged them
needleſs. But might he not as well have accuſed <hi>Paul</hi> for ſaying,
<hi>Preaching was vain,</hi> when he he ſaith, <hi>If there be no
Reſurrection, THEN is our preaching vain;</hi> as tell his Reader, that I ask
what need there is of Scripture, when I ſaid, What need is there of
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to declare the minde of God, if it may be known without it every
whit as well, as they pretend? So that this fills up the meaſure of his
Lyes.</p>
            <p>Again, I ask, Whether by the Light which is in EVERY man, ALL men
may come to know a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin had a Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And you ſay I quaere,
<hi>Whether THAT Light will ſhew a Virgin had a Son:</hi> which was not my
quaere; for I know that THAT Light (which is Chriſt) will ſhew this and all
other Truths: But what's this to the queſtion I ask, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether
this Light be in every man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which term, <hi>EVERY MAN, ALL
NATIONS,</hi> and <hi>THE WHOLE WORLD,</hi> thou deceifully leaveſt out of
moſt of <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118668:13"/>my quaeres, and ſo makes them ſpeak another
thing, and then goeſt about to anſwer them, as any one may ſee that
reades my book, and compares thy Anſwer to it; and therefore let theſe
inſtances ſuffice for the reſt, wherein the Reader may ſee thy deceit,
and alſo what-ſnuffling anſwers thou giveſt to the Twelve
<hi>Quaeres,</hi> viz. <hi>That all thoſe things I quaere</hi> (thou
ſayeſt) <hi>and much more, were made known by the Light within,</hi>
&amp;c. This is the ſubſtance of thy Anſwer. But <hi>James,</hi> how doth
this anſwer the <hi>Quaeres,</hi> which asketh thee, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther EVERY MAN hath
a Light WITHIN him, that will bring him to know that a Virgin had a Son, and
that Chriſt roſe from the dead in three days, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> We believe,
That by a Light within, theſe things were revealed to ſome men, but that's
not our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether there be in EVERY MAN a
Light, that will ſhew him theſe things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the <hi>Quaeres,</hi>
page 19. And when I ask you, What need there is of your preaching and writing
to inform the world, if the Light within the world can do it without you? You
anſwer in page 11. That <hi>there is need of preaching, to direct people to
the Light.</hi> Oh miſerable darkneſs! what can the Light within, without
any other means, direct people to the whole will of God, and cannot this Light
direct people to it ſelf without you? Is not this juſt as if a man ſhould
ſay, That the light of the Sun will ſhew men every thing but it ſelf?</p>
            <p>You anſwer the fifth Error I charge, which was, That one
<hi>John Lawſon</hi> ſaid, The Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was paſt already:
ſaying, <hi>It may be ſeen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he own it or no, by them that reade the
book:</hi> And ſo it may, if they reade but the 35 page of <hi>Sauls Errand 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118668:13"/>to Damaſcus,</hi> which is the book I cited for that
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>To the 6 and 7 Errors I charge, which is againſt one <hi>George
Fox,</hi> for ſaying, That he was the Eternal Judge of the World, and the
VVay, the Truth, and Life: You anſwer, That <hi>I prove this like the
reſt,</hi> viz. <hi>as I did foamings at your Meetings, becauſe you did not
deny it:</hi> See page 12. of your anſwer. To this I reply, (and that as I
have ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That if any ſhall print to the world, that they
are charged with ſwellings, foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, quakings, and roarings; and alſo
that theſe things are found among them in little children; and when they come
to anſwer it, ſhall onely deny to be guilty of one of theſe, and ſay
nothing to the reſt; may not a man rationally conclude theſe men guilty of
all the reſt, eſpecially conſidering it is teſtified by many
witneſſes, who are better to be believed then themſelves? In like manner
I ſtill ſay, That the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did witneſs
this againſt <hi>Fox,</hi> and he did not deny it; <hi>viz.</hi> That he
ſaid he was the Eternal Judge of the VVorld, and the VVay, Truth and Life.
Now what clearer proof can be made of any thing among men, then to witneſs
what is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the perſon charged deny it not? and yet <hi>James</hi>
ſays this is no proof. I pray if this muſt not go for proof, how will you
prove any thing to be true, that one doth not ſee?</p>
            <p>The eighth Error I charge, is, That <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid, He
that took a place of Scripture, and made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of it or from it, is a
Conjurer. This thou wouldſt excuſe, by ſaying, <hi>Theſe were not</hi>
Georges <hi>words, but the Accuſers.</hi> Indeed this is like the reſt: But
how doſt thou know they were not <hi>Georges</hi> words? Canſt 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118668:14"/>thou have the face to ſay, that they are NOT his words,
when he, though he prints the Charge, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, doth not deny it
himſelf. Here thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeſt <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf for impudency: Nay,
doth not <hi>Fox</hi> anſwer in page 7. of <hi>Sauls Errand to
Damaſcus,</hi> that he that raiſeth the Spirit out of the Letter, is a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer? And how far doth this differ from the charge? But however, is it not
more reaſonable to believe the men that witneſs this againſt him,
ſeeing he denies it not, then thee, who wilt deny that for <hi>George,</hi>
which he denies not for himſelf?</p>
            <p>The tenth Error I charge, is upon <hi>George Fox,</hi> for
ſaying, The Scriptures are carnal; and thou tell'ſt me, <hi>That this is a
Lye.</hi> But <hi>James,</hi> how dareſt thou ſay it is a Lye, when
<hi>George</hi> himſelf, in his printed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, would not tell the
Petitioners that charged him with it, <hi>They lyed;</hi> but in ſtead
thereof, evades the charge, by ſaying, <hi>The Letter of the Scripture is
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eleventh Error I charge, is upon one <hi>Leonard Fell,</hi>
which through the PRINTERS miſtake, is printed <hi>Hill:</hi> and that was,
That he ſaid Chriſt had no Body but his Church. To this thou repliedſt,
That <hi>thou doeſt not know that name,</hi> and therefore thou makeſt no
anſwer to the charge. Herein thou waſt glad to be ignorant, elſe thou
mighteſt have looked into the book and page I cited for the proof of it, and
eaſily have found it was the Printers miſtake.</p>
            <p>The eleventh Error I charge, is againſt one <hi>John
Lawſon,</hi> who ſaid, He had been in Hell, but was now in Heaven: Thou
ſayeſt, <hi>It is plain, the Saints have witneſſed being in Hell and
Heaven alſo.</hi> VVhat jugling is here! I charge him with ſaying HE had
been <pb n="23" facs="tcp:118668:14"/>in Hell, but was now in Heaven; and you tell us of the
Saints of old, that ſome of them had been in Heaven and Hell, as
<hi>Jonah</hi> was in Hell, when he was in the belly of the Whale, and
<hi>Paul</hi> was in the third Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 4. Is not this thy
Logick, <hi>James?</hi> viz. <hi>Jonah</hi> was in the Whales belly, and
<hi>Paul</hi> was in the third Heaven; <hi>Ergo, John Lawſon</hi> was in
Hell, but is now in Heaven. And you ſay, <hi>This was not an Error in them
that witneſſed this, nor in</hi> Lawſon, <hi>IF HE SAID TRUE.</hi> Now
ſee if this anſwers the charge: For how haſt thou proved he ſaid true,
when he ſaid ſo?</p>
            <p>The twelfth Error I charge, is, That you ſay you are perfect,
and ſin not. This you tell me is a Lye: and yet in the next words you ſay,
<hi>You own perfection;</hi> and you ſay, <hi>Perfection is not that that you
never had, as</hi> (you ſay) <hi>I falſly accuſe you.</hi> But
<hi>James,</hi> if thou haſt perfection, what Lye is it to ſay thou art
perfect, any more then it is a Lye to ſay one is rich, when he ſaith he
hath Riches?</p>
            <p>The thirteenth Error that I charge, is, That <hi>James Nayler</hi>
ſaid, None could come to God or Chriſt, but they that come to perfection.
<hi>By this</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>it ſeems I deny perfection to be in God or
Chriſt; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if that be granted, then they that come to
them, come to perfection.</hi> To this I anſwer, That it is one thing for men
to come to perfection, and another thing for them to come before a God that is
perfect: for <hi>Paul</hi> was not come to perſection, when he himſelf
ſaith, <hi>Not as though I had ALREADY ATTAINED:</hi> Now he had attained to
come to God and Chriſt, as I plainly ſhew in page 33. of my book; and
therefore this cunning evaſion will not ſerve thy turn: for who is there
ſo ſottiſh, as to think, that when they come to God <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118668:15"/>or Chriſt, that they come to a God or Chriſt that is imperfect?
and therefore if that ſhould be thy mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then thou waſt but beating
the air, and fighting and contending where none oppoſed thee. But by this the
world may ſee, how <hi>Janus</hi>-fac'd thy Oracles are, that look two wayes
at once: Nay, and doth not the latter end of thy anſwer to this particular,
in page 14. of thy book, plainly ſhew, that thou didſt intend perfection in
men, rather then God or Chriſt, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thou ſayeſt, <hi>The
children of God never pleaded for ſin dwelling in them?</hi> and ſo ſay I
too.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Error I charge, is, that <hi>James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
ſaid, That whenſoever they did eat or drink, they could have communion with
the Body and Blood of the Lord in eating and drinking, though it were at the
Gentiles Table. This he denies not, but ſaith, <hi>It muſt needs be counted
an Error with the Belly-gods of this world,</hi> &amp;c. But what is this to
prove, That God doth any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where require you to have communion with the Body and
Blood of the Lord, though it were at the GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILES Table? And if he do not
require it, how dareſt thou ſay thou canſt do it? and how dareſt thou
blame me for calling this an Error, when thou haſt not brought one Text to
prove it is a Truth?</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thou CANST have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with
the Body and Blood of Chriſt at the Gentiles Table:</hi> Doth not the
Scripture ſay, That <hi>the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, it is to
Devils?</hi> And doth it not alſo ſay, That <hi>we CANNOT partake of the
Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devils?</hi> and yet this man ſaith,
<hi>He can have communion with the Body and Blood of Chriſt, at the Gentiles
Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifteenth Error I charge, is, That <hi>James Parnel</hi> 
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118668:15"/>did deny all Baptiſm, but of the holy Ghoſt. To this
thou replieſt, That <hi>to own the Baptiſm of Chriſt, and to deny all
elſe, is counted an Error by me; and if ſo, then the Apoſtles did erre
alſo.</hi> How doth this follow? when they did aſſert pluralities of
Baptiſms, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where deny (as you do) all Baptiſms but that of the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> now proceeds to tell me, page 14. That <hi>I go
about to prove Water-baptiſm by Queſtions and crooked Conſequences;</hi>
and (he ſaith) <hi>that I cannot finde a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it, after Chriſts
ſufferings;</hi> and, <hi>That we cannot finde a plain Scripture for that
which we worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. And he further ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Moſes
<hi>in all his houſe did leave his Ordinances not to be proved after this
manner; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (he infers) <hi>we are not to think that Chriſt
will leave his Ordinances with ſuch kinde of proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I anſwer, Firſt, that I have aſſerted proof
for Water-baptiſm, in the queſtions propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me upon that occaſion:
See my book, page 25, 26. which thou canſt not anſwer.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, how canſt thou reject Conſequences and
Queſtions, when none have more Queſtions and conceited Conſequences, to
prove what they hold, then your ſelves?</p>
            <p>As for inſtance (to give the Reader a few among many:)</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Where have you a plain Text, without a
conſequence, that ſaith, That the Light ſpoken of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. is
IN every man that comes into the world? which you confidently affirm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, Chriſt was
the Miniſter of Circumciſion? which, thou ſaidſt, was one of my
blaſphemous Doctrines to deny, pag. 5. of thy book.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:118668:16"/>
            <p n="3">3. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, The Law was
given by Chriſt? the denyal of which, thou ſayeſt, is another of my
blaſphemous Doctrines, page 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, God ſent
ſome immediately, that could not work Miracles, or to whoſe Miniſtery he
did not witneſs from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſince you boldly affirm, that you are ſo
ſent, though you can work none?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where haſt thou a Text, that ſaith, One may have
communion with the Body and Blood of the Lord at the Gentiles Table, as you
affirm?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, He that
raifeth Spirit out of the Letter, is a Conjurer?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, The Scriptures
may not be call'd, The Word of God?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, There is no
Baptiſm but of the Spirit; which you alſo affirm?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, <hi>John
Lawſon</hi> was in Hell, but is now in Heaven?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Where have you a plain Text, that ſaith, Chriſt was
not born after the fleſh, but after the Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James,</hi> either give me expreſs Scriptures that do affirm
theſe things in the words, as thou layeſt them down, or elſe be aſhamed
to accuſe others for bringing Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, when they bring the plain
Text; whereas thou haft neither Text nor Conſequence for any of theſe thy
fond conceits.</p>
            <p>And now I cannot but give the Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that thou
ſayeſt, <hi>I have not found one Text that doth command Water-baptiſm
after Chriſts ſufferings;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>22.</hi>
LYE.</note> when, whoever looketh over the 25, 26 pages of my book, ſhall
finde ſeveral Texts to that purpoſe; and nine <pb n="27" facs="tcp:118668:16"/>ſeveral
Queſtions upon that ſubject, to which <hi>James</hi> makes no anſwer at
all, as any-body may perceive, that reades the 14 page of his book, where he
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers all, by calling what I propoſe, <hi>Crooked Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</hi>
See if the man be not here at a <hi>Nonplus!</hi> or elſe, how could he have
the face to intitle his book an Anſwer to mine, when he firſt leaves out
the firſt two pages of my book, where I ſhew their jugling about their Name
<hi>Quakers;</hi> and that they have lyed in ſaying, <hi>The world Nick-names
them ſo:</hi> and to this he ſaith nothing, but <hi>That he ſhall not
contend whether the world call them truly or falſly, when they call them
ſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, I ſpend other two pages to prove, that they do give
ſuch Titles to their Pamphlets, as they will refuſe to give to the
Scriptures: And this I prove by their own books, as the Reader may perceive;
and to this he ſayes not one word.</p>
            <p>Again, I do print the ſubſtance of two Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he
is ſo miſerably <hi>Nonplus'd,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what to ſay to
them, but onely tells his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>I do adde words that were never
ſpoken, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh Truth, to make my ſelf a cover with a Lye.</hi>
This is all that he ſaith touching the two Conferences, contained in the 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my book, as any one may ſee,
that reades the fifth page of his book: and yet he hath got ſuch a ſtock of
impudence, as to call his book an AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SWER to mine.</p>
            <p>Again I propound twelve <hi>Quaeres</hi> in the 19, 20, 21 pages
of my book: And to theſe, in ſtead of anſwering them, he propoſeth
queſtions of his own, for ſo I call them, becauſe he hath left out the
moſt material terms of mine in his tranſcribing them, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118668:17"/>his own queſtions, and not mine: and to theſe twelve
<hi>Quaeres</hi> he ſaith as little as to the other.</p>
            <p>Again, the like anſwer he gives to the nine <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> in
page 25, 26 of my book; and the ſum of his anſwer is, That they are crooked
Conſequences: See page 14 of his book.</p>
            <p>He now comes to anſwer the ſixteenth Error I charge upon them,
which was, that one of their Scribes did ask a Miniſter of the Nation,
Whether he had the Light that did inlighten every one that comes into the
world? when he had before told him, <hi>That every one HAD that Light within
him.</hi> This I charge as a piece of inconſiſtency in theſe, that would
be counted perfect. To which he replies, That <hi>Chriſt did ask the
diſciples who they ſaid he was, and yet they had the Light within them,
that revealed him to be the Son of God.</hi> But what's this to the caſe in
hand? the caſe in hand is not, whether a man may ask a queſtion for the
further confirmation of a thing that is in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as our Lord did his
Diſciples, in a time when there was various opinions of him: But, whether
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man hath preached a thing that concerneth EVERY man, whether it be not
very ridiculous to ask the ſame man to whom he hath preached, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it
concerns him? Where doth Chriſt, or any wiſe man, ask ſuch a queſtion?
Again, Chriſt demands this queſtion of them that owned him, what their
opinion was of him; but he asked the queſtion of a man that diſowned the
Light to be in every one: So that this being conſidered, I demand, Whether
Chriſt ever asked a man that did diſown him and his Light, whether his
Light was within them, or no? as this man hath done: for he asked the
queſtion of <pb n="29" facs="tcp:118668:17"/>one that was a Miniſter of the Nation, whom
they all ſay diſown the Light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He paſſeth over the ſecond inſtance of their
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, and ſaith not a word to it: I do ſuppoſe, as he
ſaid at firſt, that theſe were ſome things he would not TROUBLE
himſelf with anſwering; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I think it would trouble him to
anſwer them, and therefore he cunningly lets them alone.</p>
            <p>He comes to ſay ſomething to the third in ſtance I bring of
their inconſiſtency; and that is, that though they pretend to own the
Scriptures, yet one of them ſaid to Parſon <hi>Camelford</hi> of
<hi>Staveley-Chappel,</hi> That he might as well have burnt the Scriptures, as
his Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: He anſwers, <hi>That it doth not prove all my falſe
accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations caſt upon them,</hi> &amp;c. To this I reply, That I have not
ſpoke or writ any ſyllable of untruth concerning you; and further, it doth
prove all that I charge againſt you, about the caſe in hand, and all that I
do urge in the foregoing pages, about your ſlighting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: For, for
any one to ſay that a man might as well burn the Scriptures, as his Quaeres,
doth not this prove, that your deſign is to eat out the honour of the
Scriptures, and build up the honour of your contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious ſtories?</p>
            <p>And whereas in a Parentheſis, you queſtion if there was any
ſuch that ſaid ſo: Fie <hi>James,</hi> do not I in p. 29. of my book,
cite thoſe paſſages, and tell thee, That they are in a book call'd
<hi>Truths Defence,</hi> which is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you all? and yet you queſtion if
there be any ſuch: Doſt thou think that book did write it ſelf? and if
not, why ſhouldſt thou queſtion whether there be ſuch a man as ſaith
thoſe words in his book? for the words are there aſſerted, as I have
tranſcribed <pb n="30" facs="tcp:118668:18"/>them. But <hi>James,</hi> thou wouldſt
willingly be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this ſtory, becauſe it doth ſo much lay open
your hypocriſie and double-dealing about the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And further, is not
this book bound up, and owned by you, among the reſt of your Works? and yet
thou wouldſt fain make the Reader believe, that there was no man among you
that publiſhed ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>Thou paſſeſt over my fourth inſtance of your
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, and ſayeſt not a word to it, which would trouble thee
too much to anſwer it; and that is, That one <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> in his book
call'd <hi>A word of Reproof,</hi> p. 11. did blame the Miniſters of the
Nation for doing that they had no Rule for, when they prayed before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon (this book is alſo owned by you, and bound up with the reſt of your
ſtories) and yet <hi>Edward Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> did pray after Sermon, before
hundreds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> near
<hi>Alderſgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this inconſiſtency among themſelves he ſays not a word,
but leaps over it.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, and ſaith, The fifteenth Error I charge is a Lye,
which is, That they ſtudy deceitful terms, that look with two faces,
<hi>&amp;c. James,</hi> it is not thy ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I Lye in charging
you,</hi> that proves it to be a Lye, as any one may ſee in page 30 of my
book. And for all thou ſayeſt, <hi>A man may affirm a Negative,</hi> yet
that will not ſerve thy turn, for that is not the queſtion, but, Whether a
man being charged with ſpeaking a thing that is Negative (for that's the
caſe) doth not equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, in ſaying, <hi>He ſpake no ſuch
Affirmative?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He comes now to anſwer the eighteenth Error I charge, and that
is, Their Lying: Firſt, in ſaying, <hi>They are perfect, and ſin not:
This</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is a Lye of <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118668:18"/>mine own, and
ſhall reſt upon my head, till I prove they have ſaid ſo.</hi> To this I
anſwer, That I could prove this largely, if I ſhould trouble the Reader to
look over many of your writings: But however, to ſave that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I ſhall
cite that paſſage in page 28. of this thy book:</p>
            <p>Where you make this your ninth Quaere that you would have me
anſwer, <hi>viz. What Faith is that which pleads for ſin, and preacheth
againſt perfection? and that believes that they can never be free from ſin,
and come to perfection while they are in this world? ſhew the Saint that ſo
believed, and ſo practiſed.</hi> Let me tell thee, <hi>James,</hi> that if
this be true, that men may be free from ſin in this world, as one branch of
the queſtion doth plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; then if none of you are free from ſin,
you do not do that which you MAY do; and then you are ſelf-condemned
ſinners, if you may be free from ſin, and will not: is it not a ſhame for
you to cry out againſt thoſe that live in ſin, (who, it may be, do think
that they cannot live without ſin) and for you that believe you may live
without ſin, to live in ſin? Oh the deceit of theſe men!</p>
            <p>But if any-body ſhall ſay, That the Quakers do not live in
ſin: I anſwer, Then what lye have I told, in charging them with ſaying,
That they profeſs to be perfect? And doth not <hi>John Lilburn</hi> call
<hi>Nayler</hi> once and again (in his Book lately publiſhed, call'd his
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>) <hi>that TALL MAN in Chriſt?</hi> and yet
<hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> ſaith, <hi>I Lye,</hi> in ſaying, They profeſs to be
perfect. Now how can he be truly call'd a <hi>TALL MAN in Chriſt,</hi> that
believes a man MAY be free from ſin in this world, and yet is not free from
it himſelf?</p>
            <p>Again, may not a man believe that TALL men in <pb n="32" facs="tcp:118668:19"/>Chriſt ſhould be free from ſin in this world, if any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body may?
and yet <hi>James</hi> ſaith, I Lye, in ſaying they profeſs to be
perfect: Indeed, this is ſuch a bundle of imperfection, that if I had ſaid
they had been perfect, I had lyed indeed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Lye I charge, is, that they ſaid, <hi>They were
immediately ſent of God.</hi> To this he anſwers, that <hi>it is a Truth in
them who are ſo ſent, to ſay ſo; and the Lye</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is
my own, till I prove the contrary.</hi> To this I reply: Firſt, that this is
no anſwer to the Charge, but a meer evaſion, to ſay it is truth for a man
that is ſo ſent to ſay ſo: and I wonder when <hi>James</hi> heard that
denied by me, or any-body. But though it be a truth for a man to ſay that God
ſends him, when indeed God hath ſent him; yet it is a Lye for a man to
ſay, God ſent him, when he never did: And that he never ſent theſe
Quakers, I prove at large, in pag. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 of my
book; to which (as I have ſaid) he makes no anſwer: where I ſhew at
large, that the Turk can ſay as much for his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the Pope
for his <hi>Infallible Chair,</hi> as they can for their immediate
ſending.</p>
            <p>The third Lye I charge, is, that <hi>Fox</hi> ſaid, The world
did not know his Name; and yet afterwards ſaith, He is known by the Name of
<hi>George Fox.</hi> He anſwers, That <hi>the Saints that overcome have a new
Name,</hi> &amp;c. But what is this to <hi>George Fox?</hi> unleſs we
ſhould take it for granted, That he was an overcoming Saint? is not this a
ridiculous Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Every one that overcomes, hath a new Name;
<hi>Ergo, George Fox</hi> hath overcome, and hath a new Name?</p>
            <p>Again, he doth not ſay, The world did not know his NEW Name, but
HIS NAME, without any ſuch diſtinction.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118668:19"/>
            <p>Again, did ever any of the Saints of old ſubſcribe
themſelves as theſe do? but ſurely ſuch kinde of canting hath never
been about ſubſcribing names; unleſs it were among Thieves, that would be
known in the City by one name, and the Country by another.</p>
            <p>The fourth Lye I charge, is, that <hi>Edward Burough</hi> ſaid,
his book was ſealed with the Spirit of the eternal God: to this he anſwers,
<hi>that this is call'd a Lye, but not proved.</hi> But ſurely if any ſhall
preſume to utter ſuch a ſaying, it is more rational for him to prove the
thing affirmed, then for his reſpondent to prove what he denyes: for, if God
had ſcaled <hi>Burough</hi> his book, we ſhould have had more for the proof
of it, then his bare ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>The fifth and ſixth Lyes I charge, is about ſome paſſages
that were in a letter that <hi>James</hi> ſent me; where he ſaith, that I
did tempt him to deny the Lord; and that I did tell him, that if he came in his
own name, I would have received him. Theſe were both falſe, as many can
witneſs; for I bid him either prove he was ſent of God, or elſe diſown
his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in ſaying ſo: and for my telling him, I would have
received him, if he had come in his own name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurely if I
had been of that mind, I ſhould have received him at that time, for I did
then, and ſo I do ſtill, believe, that he never came in any bodies name but
his own, as our whole diſcourſe doth make manifeſt; though with the
falſe Prophets of old, they boaſt of their being ſent of God.</p>
            <p>And where as he adds at the bottome of his letter in Page 18. of
his book, that I ſaid, <hi>if he were ſent of God, it were to no purpoſe
to put my faith upon tryal with him, for he would overturn all my proofs:
James,</hi> thou needeſt <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118668:20"/>not witneſs this; but then
this doth ſhew thy Lyes in thy letter: Which was, that <hi>I did tempt thee
to deny the Lord;</hi> when I did at that time ſay, that if God ſent thee,
we would not ſtand to contend with thee, if thou couldeſt but prove that: I
further added, that then I would fall down under all that he ſaid; doth this
look like tempting one to deny the Lord?</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Lye that I did charge upon them, was, that he being
charged with thoſe two fore-mentioned Lyes writ in the letter, did deny that
there was any ſuch paſſages in the letter.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>that he did not know of the fetching
the letter,</hi> &amp;c. this is no anſwer to the charge; the charge is, that
he denyed he writ any ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and it is not his now printing
them, that proves he did not then deny them; which is all he urgeth to prove
it.</p>
            <p>And as for his running away, while the letter was fetching for to
prove him a Lyer; that, I did urge as an aggravation of his ſin of lying; and
that he did ſo, though he knew the letter was gone for, (though he now denyes
it) will appear by certificate at the end of this book.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in the 19. Page of his book, and ſaith, <hi>that I
make a boaſt of ſomthing I will prove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His
<hi>25.</hi> LYE.</note> and that is (ſaith he) that I ſaid, <hi>I would
prove the writings of the Scriptures to be the Word of God.</hi> For ſhame
<hi>James</hi> hide thy face: did I ever ſay any ſuch thing? nay, do not I
ſay, Page 34. the writings may be burned, but the Word of God contained in
them, cannot; And, That the Tables might be broken, but the Commands contained
in them did remain like Mount <hi>Sion?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And yet this man hath the Impudence to tell his 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118668:20"/>Reader, that I ſay, <hi>I would prove the writings of the
Scripture to be the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at this turn the Devil makes him ſpeak non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as well
as falſities; for is it not non-ſence to ſay, <hi>the writings of the
Scriptures?</hi> What is that, but in plain Engliſh to ſay, the writings of
the writings? which is abſurd, and therefore the more like the Author that
deviſed it: for my words are theſe, that the written precepts and
promiſes of God, together with his threatnings of Judgements, and
exhortations to amendment of life, they are, and ought to be called, the Words
of God: and this I have uſed arguments to prove, to which he ſays
little.</p>
            <p>His next Lye, is, that he ſaith in Page 14.<note place="margin">His <hi>26.</hi> LYE.</note> of his Book, <hi>that I would prove
that the letter of that roll is the Word of God which</hi> Baruch
<hi>read;</hi> VVhen there is no ſuch paſſage in my whole book: and
having thus ſet up a man of ſtraw, he valiantly goes to fight with him; and
ſaith, that <hi>Baruchs</hi> roll might be burned, but the VVord of God
cannot. See if this man hath not belyed me in his letters, that will thus bolye
me about things that are publiſhed in print, charging that to be in my book
which is not in it, and then go about to confute it; for I ſay nothing of
<hi>Baruch,</hi> but the very words of the text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.2, 5.</p>
            <p>He proceeds in Page 20. and calls the next proof of mine <hi>AS
CONFUSED AS THE REST;</hi> becauſe <hi>I charge them to deny the Scriptures
to be the Word, and yet ſay, I will prove the Scriptures to be the Word of
God out of their own mouths.</hi> But what confuſion is this? doth not
Chriſt prove God to be juſt, and judge the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant out of his
own mouth? And yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servant ſaid, God was not juſt; for he
ſaid, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118668:21"/>that he did reap where he ſowed not: ſo may I
judge you out of your own mouths, that deny the Scriptures to be the word, who
at ſome turns, to ſave your credit, own them: and becauſe I prove from
your own words, as doth appear by my Book, page 35. that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt
be call'd <hi>Gods Word,</hi> becauſe you ſay, nothing can declare Gods
VVill, but Gods VVord; you from hence would prove that <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs
was Gods VVord, becauſe he declared Gods VVill; and this you would faſten
as an abſurdity upon me, which is an Argument that I raiſed upon your own
principles; and therefore the abſurdity lights upon your own head, who ſay,
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can inform into the Will of God, but the Word; and yet at another time
ſay, the Scriptures declare Gods VVill, but are not his VVord.</p>
            <p>You go on ſtill in Page 20. of your book, and ſay, <hi>That I
confeſs Christ is the light that lightens every man that comes into the
World; and yet ſay, it is an error for you to ſay, that THIS light will
teach people to worſhip God rightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>James,</hi> when did I count it an error in you to ſay,
that the light of Chriſt is ſufficient to teach peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip God
rightly? this is another of thy lyes. Indeed, I have often ſaid that every
man hath not the light of Chriſt in him; and that, that light which every man
hath, is not ſufficient to teach him to worſhip God rightly: but did I ever
ſay the light of Chriſt was not ſufficient? Do I not ſay the contrary,
<hi>(viz)</hi> that the light of Chriſt is ſufficient, Page 36. of my
book?</p>
            <p>Thou goeſt on, glorying in lyes, and ſayeſt, Page 21. of thy
Book, <hi>that I do apply that text of Gods purging Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 24.14.
<hi>to the light of Chriſt, to prove it <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118668:21"/>was not
ſufficient.</hi> See thy falſe tongue! when I do bring thoſe words to
parallel with <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. to prove. That that Light is ſufficient to
inlighten all, though all have not this Light within them: See my book, page
36.</p>
            <p>You go on, and call this, The next piece of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination,
becauſe I ſay, that if every man have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Light, then every man
hath received Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All thou ſayeſt to take off the
edge of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, is, That <hi>becauſe Chriſt is that Light, I would
make that Light Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>James,</hi> what haſt thou ſaid to
the contrary? for (is it not the ſame) Chriſt is THE Son of God,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> THE Son of God is Chriſt? and how canſt thou deny this? And
yet the like Argument to this, thou calleſt Divination.</p>
            <p>You anſwer the Scripture I bring, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.10. where it
is ſaid, <hi>He that walks in the dark ſtumbleth, becauſe there is NO
LIGHT IN HIM,</hi> by telling us, <hi>There is no Light in his WAY:</hi> For
ſhame man, leave off thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scriptures! Doſt not thou adde to the
words of the book? doth not the Text ſay, <hi>There is no light in him,</hi>
and thou ſayeſt, <hi>There is no light in his WAY?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may not a man as well interpret <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and ſay,
That when the Text ſaith, <hi>He lightens every one that comes into the
world,</hi> that it is to be underſtood, of his lightning the worlds way, and
not as you notion it, That every one hath this Light in him? This is the man
that would have nothing proved by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; and yet when we have a plain
Text for what we ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That they that walk in the dark
ſtumble, becauſe there is no Light in them; he ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles it off, by
telling us, He hath no Light in his way. So that <hi>James,</hi> it ſeems we
muſt believe thy conceited <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118668:22"/>Conſequences, by which thou
wouldſt prove every man hath the Light within him, ſpoken of in
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and not the plain Text, that ſaith, He that is in the dark,
hath no light in him.</p>
            <p>You come to the next thing, and that is, that I ſay, <hi>The day
of Judgement is not paſt:</hi> This thou ſeemeſt to own to be a truth, by
bidding me prepare for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if with <hi>Lawſon,</hi> thou
didſt not believe it paſt, thou wouldſt never tell thoſe untruths, as I
have made appear thou haſt told in thy book: For, didſt thou believe
Judgement to come, thou wouldſt tremble after another manner, then ever thou
haſt done in Quaking Deluſions, and fear to lye at this rate.</p>
            <p>You go on ſtill in page 22. and touching what I have
aſſerted about Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, in page 38, 39 of my book,
you ſay, <hi>You have ſpoken ſomewhat already, and that muſt ſtand
till it be diſproved.</hi> I ſee a ſhort Anſwer ſerves your turn, or
elſe you might have told us where we might have found it, that ſo it might
be diſproved: but though thou didſt finde ſomething propoſed by me
about baptiſm, thou leapeſt over it, as though thou waſt afraid to look
on it, and ſaith nothing to ſeveral Texts alledged, and nine Queſtions
propoſed, but that <hi>I brought crooked Conſequences, and no plain
Text,</hi> &amp;c. The next work is (he ſaith) <hi>TO PROVE RESPECT OF
PERSONS,</hi> which are none of my words.</p>
            <p>And he ſaith,<note place="margin">His <hi>28.</hi> LYE.</note> I
pervert that Text in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I reade it (as
<hi>Beza</hi> renders it) <hi>Thou ſhalt honour the PERSON of the old
man:</hi> But why is this a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Text, when I have as good
reaſon to follow his tranſlation as any? But 2. is not that which is done
to the face of a man, done to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <pb n="39" facs="tcp:118668:22"/>be it honour
or diſhonour? And 3. are not theſe terms, <hi>FACE</hi> and <hi>PERSON</hi>
convertible; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.15. where it is ſaid, that <hi>The FACE of
the poor was grinded;</hi> was not this the perſon of the poor?</p>
            <p>And whereas you charge me with lying, in ſaying, you deny
reſpect due to Parents, Maſters, Husbands, Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot
but wonder at you: for I did not ſay ſo in any place of my book; I ſay,
you did deny reſpect to perſons, which I prove ought to be, becauſe I am
commanded to honour my Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I brought this to prove, we ought to honour ſome more then
others; and you ſay, I charge you with denying honour to Father and Mother,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſure <hi>James,</hi> thy Conſcience is very guilty at
this turn, or elſe thou wouldſt never have ſaid, becauſe I brought
thoſe Scriptures to prove what I laid down, that therefore I ſaid you were
guilty: But hadſt thou done fairly, thou ſhouldſt have ſpoke to the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Arguments alledged, and have ſhewed us in what ſenſe the
unjuſt Judge was blameable, in not reverencing man; and many other Texts,
which may be ſeen in page 39, 40. To all which thou ſayeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but
quarrell'ſt about that I never ſaid.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſay, That <hi>I Lye, becauſe I ſay, Not one
in ten ſhall give the ſame anſwer to a queſtion, if it be ask'd them
ſeverally:</hi> and this thou ſayeſt is <hi>a lye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (thou
ſayeſt) <hi>I never proved ten of you therein.</hi> But <hi>James,</hi>
this is as true as the reſt; for I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved twenty of you herein: and to
make it appear, I will meet thee at any time, and ask thee a queſtion
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the things of God, and not one of ten ſhall give the ſame
anſwer with thee, the queſtion <pb n="40" facs="tcp:118668:23"/>being asked apart; if
they do, I will be content to be call'd a Lyer, but not before.</p>
            <p>You ſay, the next thing I would prove, is, That <hi>Chriſt had
two Bodies.</hi> But <hi>James,</hi> why couldſt not thou as well lay down
the Propoſition in my words, as thine own? my words are, That Chriſt had a
Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beſides his Church; and to the Arguments and Texts alledged, thou
ſayeſt nothing, but tell'ſt us a few of your own Notions; as, That thou
wilt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with me, but ſayeſt, It ſerveth thee to know he is
thy head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why didſt not thou anſwer my Arguments
alledged to prove what I urged in the caſe?</p>
            <p>You go on, and ſay, <hi>You do not deny Chriſt taking
fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>James,</hi> I did draw thy veil from before the face
of the people, which thou hadſt caſt upon them, and made thee ſpeak
ſomewhat plainly at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth;</hi> and now thou
wouldſt fain ſpeak ſomewhat to cover over thy vile ſayings: but to this
I ſhall ſpeak anon.</p>
            <p>And as touching the next thing, which is, that one of them ſaid,
Chriſt was but a figure: This he ſaith is a Lye, becauſe of the PRINTERS
<hi>Errata,</hi> who put page 54 of <hi>Sauls Errand to Damaſcius,</hi> in
ſtead of page 8. in which page he hath the words I charge, though he ſaith
there is no ſuch ſaying in the book; for this very thing was objected
againſt him, and he anſwers, <hi>That Chriſt in the fleſh was a
figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas I ſhew you, that you have affinity with
<hi>Gnoſticks, Manichees,</hi> and <hi>Familiſts,</hi> &amp;c. you
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in page 24. that <hi>it is not worth anſwering;</hi> a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſhift indeed! but if I ſhould ſay ſo to your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions by and by,
you were well enough ſerved.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118668:23"/>
            <p>You go on, and tell me, that <hi>I have perverted the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> &amp;c. but haſt not ſhewed one Text wherein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be that of <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. which I have already ſhewed to be no
perverting of it.</p>
            <p>He goes on: and becauſe I ſay in page 45 of my book, that all
that I have writ againſt you, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your own Mouthes or Writings;
you ſay, <hi>This is a Lye:</hi> but <hi>James,</hi> in the ſame page,
about the middle of it, you might have found theſe words, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the
Errors I charge you with, are either ſuch as fell from your own Mouthes, or
elſe ſuch as your ſelves being charged with, could not deny. Now put all
this together, and what untruth have I told? for did you deny any of thoſe
things that I ſay you did not deny? And though you ſay the men were bloody
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that charged you, the more ſhame
for you, that you ſhould call your book an Anſwer to their Petition, and
withall print their Objections your ſelves, pretending to anſwer them; and
when all comes to all, never deny the charge in the particulars I mention, but
ſay ſomewhat elſe in ſtead thereof, which is nothing to purpoſe, as
you have done by me, as any may ſee, that reades your Anſwer both to my
book, and the <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> Petition, which is a thing I never ſaw,
any further then as your ſelves did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and print it.</p>
            <p>He now comes to the Poſtſcript at the end of my book, and
ſaith, that <hi>becauſe ſome ſaw my murtherous minde, they did write
down what he ſaid.</hi> Though that which they have writ to cover thy
Aſſertion, was not ſpoken at that time, as many can witneſs that came
out with me, whatever you ſpake after I was gone: <pb n="42" facs="tcp:118668:24"/>And
though you ſeem to carry it by witneſs, you muſt know, That your
Witneſſes are Parties, being of the ſame faith with thy ſelf,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was not born after the fleſh: and it doth behove
them to make a cloak for thee, leſt thy deeds &amp; ſayings ſhould be
made manifeſt. But whatever they have ſaid, that matters not, ſince you
confeſs all that I charge, which is, That Chriſt was not born after the
fleſh: And how have you anſwered the thing I charge in the Poſtſcript,
which is, That it is all one to be born after the fleſh, as it is to be born
according to the fleſh? and though I prove it all one in the 52, 53 pages of
my book, yet thou makeſt no kinde of anſwer; which ſhews, that thou
haſt pick'd up this Letter, to keep thee from the laſh of the Law,
becauſe thou ſayeſt, <hi>Some ſaw I had a murtherous deſign,</hi> or
elſe thou wouldſt have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what I ſay in the Poſtſcript, but
that you did fear the light.</p>
            <p>You proceed, and in page 26. ſay, that I ſay, <hi>The
Scriptures make no ſuch diſtinction, as born after the fleſh, and after
the Spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <hi>29.</hi> LYE.</note> This is another
of thy Lyes: Where do I ſay any ſuch thing in all my book? but this I
ſaid, That the Scriptures made no diſtinction between a being born after
the fleſh, and born accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>And you ſay again, That <hi>Chriſt, as he was born of</hi>
Mary, <hi>was not born after the fleſh, but begotten and brought forth by
Promiſe.</hi> To this I anſwer, Firſt, that this is nothing to the
queſtion; for though he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and brought forth by promiſe, doth
this prove, that therefore he was not borne after the fleſh? for
<hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne according to the promiſe, yet he was borne after
the fleſh likewiſe; So Gods promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118668:24"/>Chriſts Birth, doth not prove, that therefore he was not borne
according to the fleſh. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſay'ſt, he that was borne after
the fleſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him that was born after the Spirit; I ſay, that
though this be true in ſinfull unregenerate men, that have no other Birth and
generation, then what was after the fleſh: yet it is not true in Chriſt,
and his being borne after the fleſh; for he being without ſin, did not
perſecute him that was borne after the Spirit, as ſinfull men do. And
therefore <hi>James,</hi> becauſe thou ſay'ſt Chriſt was not borne
after the fleſh, ſhew me a plain text for ſuch a Doctrine, without any of
theſe conceited conſequences; or elſe take ſhame to thy ſelf, for
finding fault with proofs that others bring, when they do not give the
expreſs text.</p>
            <p>Thou telleſt me of my promiſe to repent, if I ſhould be
better informed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this I anſwer, that thou haſt rather
ſtrengthened my former opinions of thee, then any way better informed me,
except I will take thy bare ſaying I lye, for a better information.</p>
            <p>Thou now comeſt upon me with a pack of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which I
ſhall anſwer.</p>
            <p>His firſt queſtion is, whoſe Spirit that is which men
underſtand the Scriptures with, and try Spirits with, who are without the
Spirit of God? Seeing thou affirms, that a man may underſtand Scriptures
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of God? or whether God hath ſet up ſuch a tryer, yea or
no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greateſt part <hi>of this queſtion, is
grounded</hi> upon a falſe bottome, <hi>(viz.) (ſomething that I
ſaid)</hi> which is moſt part falſe; for I did never ſay thoſe words:
yet I have anſwered to them, ſo far as I am concerned, in my anſwer to
thy letter which thou <pb n="44" facs="tcp:118668:25"/>ſent'ſt to me, after our meeting
at <hi>Gerard Roberts,</hi> in the former part of this book: but yet if by
underſtanding the Scriptures, thou doeſt mean all things contained in them;
I ſay, this he cannot do without Gods Spirit: and if by trying Spirits, thou
meanſt, to try between your Spirits, and the Spirit of Chriſt; I can ſay
again, that a man without the Spirit of God, may by his own Spirit
underſtand, that you are not guided by the Spirit of truth, that have told
ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Queſt. Seeing thou confeſſeth Chriſt to be
the true light, and that he lighteth every man that comes into the World, but
denyes that light to be within; ſhew in plainneſs, where he doth inlighten
every man that comes into the World, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and how they come by it:
and ſeeing thou ſay'ſt every man hath it; how have they it, and not
within?</p>
            <p>This is anſwered already in Page 51. of my book, called
<hi>Quakers quaking.</hi> The later part of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a lye: for I
never ſaid, that every man hath the light of Chriſt, though Chriſt hath
uſed means to bring the World to the light, that their deeds may be reproved.
But leſt both my books ſhould not come to the readers hand, I do again
anſwer, that Chriſt is ſaid to inlighten the World, as he pardoneth their
ſins; though none but them that believe ſhall receive remiſſion of
ſins, yet he pardoneth their ſins, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a way for the pardon of
them; So Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man (I, and that within too, if you will
have it) by giving them means to be inlightened within, though thouſands
(like your ſelves) ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe there is no light in them.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:118668:25"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing thou confeſſeſt, that the
heathen have a light that reproves them of ſin, but not within, ſhew where
it is, and what it is; whether the light of Chriſt or no, and how they came
by it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the heathen may have a light among them,
that may not be in them, I have already ſhewn in my former book, Page 52. but
further, did not Chriſt tell the Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.2. that the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God was within them, when indeed it was but among them? and ſo
the margent reads it: for they were far enough from having his Kingdome erected
in their inward man. In like manner may God ſend light among the heathen,
which may not be within every individial man of them. And whereas you ask me,
what light it is? I ſay, it is the light of nature, which taught them to do
by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law. And whereas you ask, how they came
by it? I anſwer, that, that manifeſtation they have, is from God, for God
hath ſhewed it to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether that which reproves the
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then when they ſin, be the ſame that reproves thee when thou
ſinneſt, and the reſt, who call your ſelves believers? and whether it
be in the ſame place? and wherein doth it differ, as to place, nature, and
opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, Firſt, that, that which
reproves the heathen of ſin, doth reprove us and you too. And as touching the
place, I confeſs it is an odd term: yet I anſwer, that it is the
conſcience that muſt be reproved of ſin, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
but yet this light may differ in the nature of it, as the light of the Moon
differs from the Sun; and as a man may <pb n="46" facs="tcp:118668:26"/>ſee further by the
light of the Sun, then he can by the light of the Moon; even ſo may them that
have the light of Chriſt, have a further inſpection into the things of
Chriſt, then the Gentiles who walk by the light of nature: yet that light of
nature we have (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the light of the Goſpel) which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of ſins againſt nature; but for ſins in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
circumſtances, relating to Gods worſhip, the light of nature will not
convince: and here theſe lights differ in operation alſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The fifth Queſtion is, whether your
light, who call your ſelves believers, be within you? and if within you, how
came you by it, when you were in darkneſs, as the moving cauſe? and if
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, how doth it inlighten, and not within? and where doth it abide for
you, that is not in you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, that God which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the
light to ſhine out of darkneſs, is he which hath ſhined in our hearts, to
give the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. this being anſwered, there is no need of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the
later part of this quaere, for the light that is in believers doth abide in
their hearts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether that light which is not within,
can inlighten the heart and underſtanding? Whether the Goſpel be not hid to
all who have their hearts and minds blinded? and whether it be not the work of
the God of this World, to blind hearts? whether ſuch as deny the light
within, and preach againſt it, leſt people ſhould believe in it, be not
in his work and Miniſtry, yea or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To the former part of this Queſtion, I
Anſwer by conceſſion: to the later part, if by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118668:26"/>againſt Light within, you mean preaching againſt the
Light of Chriſt in his Saints, we make one minde with you; but if you mean
preaching againſt your notion, <hi>viz.</hi> That every one hath the light of
Chriſt in him; then I ſay, that a man may preach againſt this, and ſay
with <hi>John, He that walks in the dark, hath no Light in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Queſt.</hi> VVhat kinde of Faith thine is, who
haſt denied the Faith that is the gift of God? and how thou cameſt by it,
which God did not give thee? and whether that Faith which is not of God, he not
of the Devil, yea or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This queſtion is grounded upon another of thy
falſe ſuggeſtions, as I have ſhewed already: For though I deny thy
Faith to be Gods gift, yet I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell thee that my Faith was not his
gift: and though I do ſay, That no Faith is the gift of God as you fancy it,
to wit, that men muſt do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining it, but wait till
they are puft up with your quaking dotages; yet I do ſay, that we ought to
contend for that Faith that was once <hi>GIVEN</hi> to the Saints.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Did ever any of the Saints profeſs a
Faith which they received not of God? and whether thy contention be for the
Faith once delivered to theſe Saints? and if ſo, from whom hadſt thou it,
ſeeing thou denieſt it to be the gift of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This queſtion is the ſame with the former,
and therefore the ſame anſwer will ſerve to it, as to the former.
However, I cannot but take notice, that thou multiplieſt words without
knowledge, or elſe thou mighteſt have ſeen this queſtion to be the
ſame with the former, and grounded upon the ſame falſity.</p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>Queſt.</hi> What Faith is that which pleads for
ſin, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118668:27"/>and preacheth againſt perfection? that believes
they can never be free from ſin, nor come to perfection, while they are in
this world? ſhew the Saints that ſo believed, and ſo preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I have in part anſwered already, ſome
pages before, when I proved, that by the import of this queſtion, that you
profeſt to be perfect men; which you were forced to deny, when I laid ſo
many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and inconſiſtencies upon you, that you leaped over
many, and did not anſwer them; yet I ſhall adde this further, That the
Faith which pleads for ſin, is of the Devil (if ſuch a thing may be call'd
Faith) and from beneath: but where didſt thou learn this dialect, as to call
a pleading for ſin, Faith? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture notes it for unbelief.</p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is not the end of Chriſts
Miniſtery for the perfecting of the Saints? and is not that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
whoſe Miniſtery is againſt it? or is Chriſts Miniſtery now changed
from what it was?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The end of Chriſt Miniſtery, is for the
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Saints; and that is Antichriſts Miniſtery that is againſt
it; and Chriſts Miniſtery is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from what it was.</p>
            <p n="11">11 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether that Faith which is not of God
can receive the things of God, or can be imputed for righteouſneſs to him
that hath it? And is not his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of himſelf, whoſe Faith is
of himſelf? or can it be otherwiſe, if it be the righteouſneſs of
Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This queſtion is confuſed like the qerent that
made it, or elſe he would never ask, whether the Faith which is of God, can
receive the things of God? and, Is not his righteouſneſs of
<hi>HIMSELF,</hi> whoſe <hi>FAITH</hi> is of <pb n="49" facs="tcp:118668:27"/>
               <hi>HIMSELF?</hi> and yet ask in the latter end of the ſame Quaere,
If it can be <hi>OTHERWISE,</hi> if it be the Righteouſneſs of Faith?
Therefore till he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better how to make a queſtion, I ſhall
forbear to anſwer any otherwiſe, but that he that hath not the Faith of
God, is not of God; neither can any other Faith be imputed for
Righteouſneſs, then that which is of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether he that hath not received the
Faith, be not an infidel? or is he to be believed in matters of God and
Chriſt? And being of a falſe Faith, is it ſafe to believe what he ſaith
againſt the children of Light?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by the Faith of God, you mean the Faith that
you do profeſs, which is, That Chriſt was not born after the fleſh; then
I ſay, That this Faith is not the gift of God, neither is he an infidel that
hath not received it; neither is he to be believed in matters of God and
Chriſt, whatſoever he talks and prates of, if he have ſuch a falſe
Faith Neither is it ſafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what a man of ſuch a

thou doſt confeſs in thy book) and then to deny that Light to be in that

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou mighteſt as well ask, whether
<hi>John</hi> did not ſpeak Non-ſenſe, in ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.
<hi>That Chriſt is the true Light, that lightens every one that comes into
the world;</hi> and yet afterwards in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.10. ſayes, <hi>If a
man do walk in the night he ſtumbles, becauſe there is no Light IN
HIM.</hi> But to this I have ſpoke once and again, in my laſt and this
alſo.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:118668:28"/>
            <p n="14">14 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether <hi>Paul</hi> was rightly
call'd and endued to the Miniſtery, who was not ſent to baptize? and
whether it was not a ſign that <hi>John</hi> was decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and Chriſt
increaſing, that being left out in <hi>Pauls</hi> Command, who was call'd
after Chriſt was offered up? And cannot a man now be a Miniſter of
Chriſt, and not ſent to baptize?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> was rightly
call'd and endued, though (he ſaith) he was not ſent to baptize. But
<hi>James,</hi> how canſt thou prove, that this relates to his not baptizing
with water; ſince thou wilt not have that Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ſo
underſtood? but tell'ſt me, our underſtanding the Text to be meant of
water, is a crooked Conſequence, becauſe the word WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER is not expreſt:
though thereupon I have ſaid ſo much, that it would trouble thee to
anſwer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou cunningly ſlipſt it over, and ſayſt
nothing to it. And now <hi>James,</hi> how canſt thou, without the like
Conſequence, prove this was meant of water, ſince the word water is not
here expreſt? But 2. if that be granted, that it is meant of water, doth this
prove (becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He was NOT ſent to baptize</hi>) that
therefore he was not in any ſenſe commanded to it? Doth not the Scriptures
ſometimes lay down ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that are to be underſtood chiefly and
eminently, and not excluſively? as, <hi>Labour NOT for the meat that
periſheth;</hi> doth this therefore prove, that believers are not to labour
for earthly bread at all, but eat the bread of idleneſs, as you do? in like
manner is this ſaying of <hi>Pauls</hi> to be underſtood, who though he was
not chiefly and eminently ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, yet he
alſo did baptize, as the ſame place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 16. doth
declare. Now if <hi>Paul</hi> did baptize, <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118668:28"/>it was either in
the Name of God and Chriſt, or his own Name; but it was not in his own Name,
for this he denies, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. when he ſaith, <hi>Either were you
ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the Name of Paul?</hi> Well then, if he did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize in the Name
of Chriſt, then I quaere, Whether it be not great wickedneſs to do a thing
in the Name of God or Chriſt, that Chriſt never commanded? and therefore I
ſay, <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, he was not ſent to baptize, doth not prove,
that therefore <hi>John</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; if by decreaſing you mean,
that the things that <hi>John</hi> was a Preacher of ſhould decreaſe; for,
<hi>John</hi> was a Preacher of Repentance, as well as Water-baptiſm: And may
you not as well ſay, That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in one thing, as well as another?
And to the laſt branch of the quaere, I ſay, That in the ſenſe
<hi>Paul</hi> was a Miniſter of Chriſt, and was not ſent to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, a
man may be a Miniſter of Chriſt now: But did you ever finde a Miniſter of
Chriſt in all the New Teſtament, that did not baptize at all, or that
ſaid as you do, That Baptiſm with water is not Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</p>
            <p n="15">15 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Your next queſtion is, ſeeing the

Whether one may not be baptized into the Name of Father, Son, &amp; Holy
Ghoſt, without being dipt in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal water? alſo, whether all you dip in
water, you ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt? if the
firſt of theſe be Yea, and the later No, then I conclude, that carnal
dipping is not the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for thy word <hi>carnal water,</hi> it is a
word of thy own; and therefore I have nothing to ſay to it. But as touching
the reſt of the queſtion, I ſay, That the former is Nay, and the latter
Yea, to uſe your own <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118668:29"/>phraſes; for none were ever
baptized into the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that were not
ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized with water; and do thou prove it if thou canſt, without a crooked
Conſequence, and I will believe all you ſay: and the latter is Yea, for we
do not baptize any, but we do it in the Name of Father, Son, and holy
Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="16">16 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Doth every one that reades the Bible,

            <p>

mean the written Commands of God, and his Promiſes to them that obey, and his
Threatnings to them that obey not. And whereas you ask me, what difference is
between the miniſtration of the letter now, and that in the Jews time,
ſince both denied the Faith which is the gift of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
wonder at thy ignorance, <hi>James;</hi> doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. that the miniſtration written with <hi>Letters,</hi> was
<hi>glorious?</hi> and was not that to the Jews in the Jews time? and yet thou
haſt the face to ſay, That the miniſtration of the letter in the Jews
time, did deny the Faith of God; and ſo thou ſayeſt now: But where haſt
thou a text for this, that proves the miniſtration of the letter to deny the
Faith of God at any time? is not this one of thy brain-ſick Notions? And
whereas you ask, if it would ſave now <pb n="53" facs="tcp:118668:29"/>without the Spirit,
more then in their dayes? I ſay, That queſtion is needleſs; for, neither
then nor now can men be ſaved, without Gods Spirit: But what's this to thy
purpoſe, who ſaith, That the miniſtration of the letter in the Jews time,
and now, do both deny the Light and Faith, which is the gift of God? For
ſhame man leave off thy talking of God, without thou couldſt ſpeak more
to purpoſe, and leſs to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!</p>
            <p n="17">17 <hi>Queſt.</hi> VVhether that righteouſneſs that a
man reades in the letter, ſets him to do the like without Faith, which is the
gift of God, or the leadings of the Light of Chriſt, the miniſtration of
the Spirit, be the righteouſneſs of Faith, or Self-righteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The letter no where ſets men to do the
righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which it calls for, without the Faith of God and Chriſt.
2. To the latter part of your queſtion, I anſwer, That the
righteouſneſs of Faith which men have by the Light of Chriſt, and the
miniſtration of the Spirit, is not ſelf-righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus have I plainly and faithfully tranſcribed thy queſtions,
and anſwered them; which in reaſon thou couldſt not expect, ſince thou
haſt left mine unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And were it not but that thou wouldſt have
been wiſe in thy own conceit, I ſhould ſcarce have taken the pains; and
if thou ſhouldſt joy in the ſtrength of thy Quaeres, know, That the joy
of the hypocrite will be but for a moment, till my Anſwer can overtake
them.</p>

            <p>SOme paſſages thou haſt, for which there is but his
<hi>Yea,</hi> and my <hi>Nay;</hi> and therefore, that you may know on which
ſide the truth lieth, examine my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book, and his Anſwer, and ſee if
that he hath not accuſed that book of many things, that were neither in the
book, nor the Authors heart: and by that thou wilt perceive, that he that will
not ſtick to belye me in a matter ſo publickly made known, as my book is,
will not matter to do the like, and worſe, concerning what I ſpake more
private. And alſo compare this Reply with his Anſwer, and ſee if I have
falſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or perverted any ſaying in his book, but have faithfully
and impartially tranſcribed them; and ſee if I have omitted replying to any
thing that is of weight, or indeed to the lighteſt thing that doth but look
like an Argument; and ſee alſo, if he hath not left out many Arguments, and
many Pages, to which he ſaith nothing; and whether he hath not added to, and
taken from moſt things that he mentions of my book, and then attempts to
anſwer it. And whereas he would excuſe his Error of denying Chriſt born
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, by ſaying, That <hi>that which is born after the fleſh,
is fleſh, and that which is born after the Spirit, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> Whether
by the rule of Contraries, it doth not undeniably follow, That that which is
NOT born <pb n="55" facs="tcp:118668:30"/>after the fleſh, is not fleſh? and then, what
doth he leſs, then deny Chriſt to be made fleſh, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. whatever he ſaith
to the contrary? Conſider, and weigh things aright, and the Lord give you

               <hi>REader,</hi> Theſe may certifie, That <hi>Jer: Ives</hi> did
not utter any ſuch thing as <hi>James Nayler</hi> falſly charges upon him,

obedience to be Gods gift, but in the ſenſe mentioned in this Reply:
Neither did he ſay any of thoſe things; as, That the Wilderneſs where
<hi>John</hi> baptized was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. And we do further
certifie, That the account he hath given of that Conference at <hi>Gerard
Roberts,</hi> in this Reply to <hi>James Nayler,</hi> is true; we being there
all the time, and heard none of thoſe things, ſave what <hi>Jer: Ives</hi>
